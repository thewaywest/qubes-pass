## qubes-pass.ReadKeys
##
## Describe access rules between qubes-pass client vms and
## qubes-pass server vms. By default, service requests are
## always blocked ("deny"). Grant gated access ("ask") or
## free access ("allow") to certain qubes with new lines.

## Note that policy parsing stops at the first match,
## so anything below "$anyvm $anyvm" will have no effect.

## Please use a single # to start your custom comments.

$anyvm $anyvm deny
